Pilot_model.py contains the domian information to simulate a pilot scale MET system wiht a single bacterial species and single substrate. 
The preamble contains all variables which can be altered to adjust geometry size, retention times and simulation length. 
All electrochemical variables are specisifed and consistent with the model defined in  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132686

2) Pilot_model.py - Main python script for simulaiton of a single population single substrate MET system
3) Plotting_jd.py - Custom ploting functions
4) Solver.py - Fluid solving algorithm returning the steady state solution
