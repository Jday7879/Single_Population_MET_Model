Pilot_model.py contains the domain information to simulate a pilot-scale MET system with a single bacterial species and a single substrate. 
The preamble contains all variables which can be altered to adjust geometry size, retention times and simulation length. 
All electrochemical variables are specified and consistent with the model defined in  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132686
